9pedit - Batch editing for 9-patch pngs

Syntax:
	9pedit {command options} file...
	
Each file is processed in order and the commands given on the command
line are applied to each.  When all commands are applied to a file it
is saved.  If the commands result in a 9-patch, a .9.png will be saved.
If the commands result in a regular .png, then a .png file will be saved.

Command options:
	-out dir: Write all files to the given directory instead of source directory
	-clear: Reset the 9-patch border to #00000000.  Presumes that a border is present
			Converts to .9.png if not already.
	-strip: If is a .9.png, converts back to a standard .png, removing the border
	-sx {pixels}: Set the given pixels on the x-scale axis (top)
	-sy {pixels}: Set the given pixels on the y-scale axis (left)
	-px {pixels}: Set the given pixels on the x-padding axis (bottom)
	-py {pixels}: Set the given pixels on the y-padding axis (right)
	-template {source.9.png}: Gets border information from another file
	-expand WxH: Expand a 9-patch to W by H pixels (including 9-patch border)
	
All arguments that take {pixels} take a comma delimitted list of zero based
pixel numbers or ranges.  Example: 0,1,10-20
